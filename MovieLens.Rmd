## Introduction

The MovieLens project goal is to build up a prediction system for movies ratings based on a historical series of records. The dataset we will use as base to create our model is called **edx**, while the dataset where we will measure the efficiency of our model, as if we did not know the given ratings, is the called **validation**.
We therefore first read these two datasets that we have previously already dowloaded.

```{r datasets reading}
movielens <- load("C:/Users/PAOLA/projects/movielens/rda/movielens.rda")
movielens[1,]
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
